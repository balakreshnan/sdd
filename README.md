# Social Distancing Project

## Use Case 

Ability to detect social distancing in side a facility and ability to report on it. 
This system is just information and ability to inform necessary folks. 

This system doesn't enforce any actions.

The idea here is not build from scrath but taking what is available and make it as solution.
